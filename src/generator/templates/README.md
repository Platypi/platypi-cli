# {{appName}}

This README is auto-generated by the Platypi CLI. Below you can find instructions on how to use this project.

## Installation

Use `npm install` to install the dependencies for this package.

## Typical Scenarios

### Development

When developing your app you want to do a couple of things:

0. Run a server to serve your app on `localhost`
0. Watch your TypeScript files and compile/bundle your TS/JS when a file changes.
0. Watch your Less files and compile your Less when a file changes.

Your `package.json` has a `start` script that will do these things for you. So when you are developing you can simply run:

```
$ npm start
```

The default server configuration is to serve assets on `http://localhost:3000` from the `app` directory.

> **NOTE**: `npm start` does not minify your javascript files in order to speed up your development builds

### Cordova

When you're ready to build for your cordova project there are a couple of things you want to do:

0. Compile/Bundle/minify your TypeScript, JavaScript, and Less files.
0. Copy your assets (fonts, images) as well as your distribution source files (app.js, app.css, index.html) into the `cordova/www` directory
0. Modify your index.html to include cordova specific tags (i.e. including `cordova.js`, specifying the CSP/viewport meta tags, etc)
0. Build your cordova project

Your `package.json` has a `build:cordova` script that will do all of this for you. When you are ready to build your cordova project simple run:

```
$ npm run build:cordova
```

## Build Configuration

This app uses `npm run-script` or `npm run` scripts to manage all the building/deployment. You can see all 
the scripts in the `package.json`. You can also print the scripts to the command line console by typing `npm run`.

### Useful Scripts

The following are descriptions for a few of the useful npm scripts. All of these scripts can be executed using the `npm run <script>` command.

- **build**
  - Builds the `less` and `ts` files

- **build:cordova**
  - Builds/bundles/minifies your `less` and `ts`
  - copies the necessary files to `/cordova/www`
  - runs `cordova build`

- **clean**
  - Cleans your `app` directory, removing css/js/map files and your `dist` directory

- **lint**
  - Runs `tslint` on all of your `ts` files
  - You can specify your custom lint rules in your `tsconfig.json`
  - Default rules can be found at the [tsconfig-lint](https://github.com/wjohnsto/tsconfig-lint#user-content-default-rules) project

- **prepublish**
  - Runs during `npm install`
  - Installs/links TypeScript declarations using [tsd](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/)
  - Runs [tsconfig-glob](https://github.com/wjohnsto/tsconfig-glob) to setup your `tsconfig.json`

- **start**
  - Builds/bundles your src files and watches them for changes
  - Rebuilds/bundles when your src files change
  - Starts server that serves assets from the `app` directory on http://localhost:3000

- **tsd**
  - Installs/links TypeScript declarations using [tsd](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/)

## Cordova

When creating an app you can choose whether or not you want to also create a Cordova app. There are a few things you want to know when creating/interacting with your Cordova app.

### Requirements

Refer to the [android](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html#Android%20Platform%20Guide) and [ios](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/guide_platforms_ios_index.md.html#iOS%20Platform%20Guide)
platform guides to help you get setup with a Cordova environment.

### Working in Teams

It can be tricky to share a Cordova app project with other team members over source control. The recommended way we've found is by checking in your configuration to source control.

- Make sure you check-in your `cordova/config.xml`
- Check-in the `cordova/res` files
- Ignore everything else

You can use the `config.xml` to store project configuration, so that other team members can restore the same project specification on their machine.

- When adding a plugin, use the `--save` flag to save the plugin information (name and version specification) to the `config.xml`
- When adding a platform, the `--save` flag will store the platform information similar to the plugins
  - **NOTE** It is not recommended to save `ios` or `windows` platform information to the `config.xml` to avoid compatibility issues across platforms.

### Interaction with the CLI

The CLI tries to be non-invasive when it comes to Cordova. There is a `plat cordova` command which basically serves as a way to execute `cordova` 
cli commands from anywhere in your project. In other words:

- Normally any `cordova` commands must be run from within a cordova project
- With the CLI you can run `plat cordova` and it will automatically run the cordova command in your cordova project

`plat cordova run android --device` allows you run your cordova app on a device without changing to the `cordova` directory.
